# Stern_Brocot_Sequence__JAVA

this java program generates whats called the stern number sequence. which is somewhat similar to fibonacci sequence. 
but in ster-brocot sequence we add the previos two numbers and carry over the last number.  

example  starting with 1,1

1+1 = 2 now tbring the last number which 1. and we have 1,1,2,1
we can generate the sequnce by following this pattern 

for example the firts 10 numbers are 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3

This program may be used or modified by anyone who needs it.
